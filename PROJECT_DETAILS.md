# KEYWORD REPLACEMENT

## Description

Keyword replacement in a corpus: In text analytics, often it is required that a set of keywords are replaced with a given set for the documents in hand. For example, on Twitter, people write a lot of abbreviations. When one requires to analyze the tweets, (s)he should find all the abbreviations in a given list of abbreviations (e.g. ASAP, won’t) and replace all these brief terms in the tweets with its proper phrase/keywords (e.g. ASAP -> As soon as possible, or won’t ->  will not).

## Goal

- To  design  an  algorithm that  finds  all  of  the  keywords  that  are  in  the abbreviation list in each tweet, and then replace them with the appropriate given keyword/phrase.
    - The number of tweets  can  be  millions  and  the  list  of  keywords  can  be  hundreds.
- A  naïve  approach  is  that  for  each  tweet, your algorithm checks for all of the elements in the abbreviated list and replaces them.
- Other than the naïve approach, design a better algorithm and apply these required four steps:
    - **Problem formulation**
        - Formulate the problem as an algorithmic problem.
    - **Algorithm design and analysis**
        - There is a straightforward solution to the problem you are trying to solve.
        - Let’s name it algorithm A. This algorithm will have at least O(n2) (or more depending on the project O(n3), etc).
        - You are required to design a more efficient algorithm (call it B), prove its correctness, and compare (using the asymptotic notation) the time complexity of the two algorithms.
    - **Implementation and Empirical Evaluation**
        - Implement your algorithm B and the algorithm A, and perform simulations to empirically compare their running times.
        - Your implementation shall have a class named ProjectName with two public methods algorithmAforProject(X) and algorithmBforProject(X).
        - Both methods shall return the required results.
    - **Choice of Data Structure**
        - Clearly explain your choice of data structure to implement your algorithms.
        - Reason about why you choose this  data  structure  over  others  and  what  are  the  pros  and  cons.
        - In  some  projects,  you  should  think  of searching with O(n) when one data structure is used, compared to non-linear time using another one.
